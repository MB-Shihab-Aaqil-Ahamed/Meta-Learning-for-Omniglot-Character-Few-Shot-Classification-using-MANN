# Meta-Learning-for-Omniglot-Character-Few-Shot-Classification-using-MANN

Memory Augmented Neural Network (MANN) is implemented  and it is used to classify the Omniglot Handwritten Character recognition. The Neural Turing Machine (NTM) is a fully differentiable implementation, a model designed for rapid memory encoding and retrieval. The NTM consists of a controller, which can be a feed-forward network or LSTM, interacting with an external memory module through multiple read and write heads. This powerful combination enables efficient classification of Omniglot characters, showcasing the potential of meta-learning techniques in the realm of few-shot classification tasks.
